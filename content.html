	This is the landing page of all TYPO3 packages. Be welcome and make your choice between the different flavor. There
	is here the&nbsp;opportunity to make an idea of the capability of TYPO3 products. All packages have an login with
	different access level. Log in as admin in the Backend&nbsp;for in depth&nbsp;exploration or as&nbsp;an Editor to
	see an&nbsp;optimized User Interface addressing&nbsp;"basic"&nbsp;User. Notice also, that <strong>not all features
	are enabled such as file upload, third-party extension installation, etc... for obvious security reasons</strong>.

<p>This is an example of a typical TYPO3 installation that bundles an XHTML template, the TYPO3 source and some well-known
	extensions. Download this if you want to try out TYPO3 and play around with it, or just to get a basic site with a predefined
	template up and running.<strong style="font-style: normal; "> To install, you need a webserver on your local machine or a
		hosted webserver</strong>. Unzip the package, create a Virtual Host pointing at the root of the directory, open the
	browser and go to the installation wizard.
